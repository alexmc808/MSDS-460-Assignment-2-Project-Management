**User:**
Please act as a veteran project manager. Using the following information from a Forbes article, please provide reasonable best case scenario hours, expected hours, and worst case scenario hours for the tasks listed below in an upcoming project in a tabular format:

Relevant Forbes article information:
There are usually three stages of software development. They are:
Requirements and design (2-4 weeks)
Planning, architecture, and development (3-6 months)
Software testing (3-6 weeks)
And while I explained three main stages in the software development process, often there are more; for some projects, I recommend adding a stage of cost optimization (mostly for huge platforms) or a separate deployment stage.

Tasks:

Describe product
Develop marketing strategy
Design brochure

Software Development Project Estimates (in Hours)
Veteran Project Manager's Perspective:

Based on the information provided and my experience, here's a breakdown of estimated hours for each task, considering best case scenario, expected hours, and worst case scenario:

Task	Best Case (Hours)	Expected Hours (Hours)	Worst Case (Hours)
Describe Product	16	40	80
Develop Marketing Strategy	20	50	100
Design Brochure	10	20	40
Develop Product Prototype			
Requirements Analysis	10	20	40
Software Design	20	40	80
System Design	15	30	60
Coding	40	120	240
Write Documentation	20	40	80
Unit Testing	15	30	60
System Testing	20	40	80
Package Deliverables	5	10	20
Survey Potential Market	20	40	80
Develop Pricing Plan	10	20	40
Develop Implementation Plan	15	30	60
Write Client Proposal	10	20	40

Notes:
Product Prototype Development: This section has separate breakdowns for various sub-tasks involved in building a prototype. The total estimated hours will depend on the complexity of the prototype.
Project Phases: While the Forbes article mentions 3 main stages, this project might benefit from additional phases like "Deployment" depending on the specific needs. The estimated hours don't account for a separate deployment phase.

Additional Considerations:
Team experience: A more experienced team can complete tasks faster.
Project complexity: More complex features will require additional time.
Client involvement: More client feedback loops can extend timelines.
Remember: These are just estimates. The actual time needed for each task can vary depending on the specific project details. As a veteran project manager, I would recommend:

Detailed planning: Break down tasks further and estimate sub-tasks.
Team communication: Keep everyone informed and on track.
Buffer time: Allocate extra time to accommodate unforeseen issues.
Client collaboration: Work closely with the client to manage expectations.
By following these tips, you can increase your chances of a successful project delivery within your estimated timeframe.

**User:**
For each of the following tasks, can you estimate how many of each of the following roles are required: project manager, frontend developer, backend developer, data scientist, data engineer, and database administrator.

Tasks:
Describe product
Develop marketing strategy
Design brochure
Develop product  prototype
    Requirements analysis
    Software design
    System design
    Coding
    Write documentation
    Unit testing
    System testing
    Package deliverables
Survey potential market
Develop pricing plan
Develop implementation  plan
Write client proposal

Here is additional context: 

"You need to propose a consumer-focused recommendation system for more than one hundred restaurants in Marlborough, Massachusetts, as shown in the enclosed file: restaurants-v001.json 
Download restaurants-v001.json
. Data for the project will consist of Yelp reviews of these restaurants. This list of restaurants should be updated monthly, with Yelp reviews updated daily. Given the limitations of open-source Yelp reviews, it is likely that a contract will be obtained to access large quantities of Yelp data through its GraphQL API.
The client requires selected software components for the project. In particular, the client asks that the product recommendation system be implemented using Alpine.js and Tailwind on the frontend, a GraphQL API, and a Go web and database server on the backend. Go, Python, or R may be employed for recommender system analytics on the backend, with persistent storage provided by PostgreSQL, EdgeDB, or PocketBase. The system should be accessible from any modern web browser and may be hosted on a major cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)."

Additional Considerations:
The project complexity increases due to the data focus and external data source.
The team's skillset is assumed to be highly skilled, allowing some role sharing.
The specific chosen database solution (PostgreSQL, EdgeDB, or PocketBase) might influence the Database Administrator's workload.
